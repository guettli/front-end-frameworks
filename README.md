# List of front-end frameworks

A List of css-frameworks: https://github.com/topics/css-framework

This is about HTML+CSS frameworks. Not about JavaScript. I am searching a solution which works with React, Vue or [html-over-the-wire](https://github.com/guettli/html-over-the-wire)

Most frameworks started several years ago, and they were made for old browsers like IE11.

I don't need to support IE11. I want a small and modern framework.

# Suitable

https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap Bootstrap5. Still alpha, not release yet.

https://github.com/pure-css/pure very small.

https://github.com/uikit/uikit Version 3 available since 2017. With constant updates. But don't confuse it with [uikit of apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit)


# Unsuitable

https://github.com/shoelace-style/shoelace one-man-show

https://github.com/jgthms/bulma Almost all commits are from one account. One-man-show?

https://github.com/materializecss/materialize fork of the orignal Materialize repo. Unsure if this will get long-term love.

https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap Bootstrap4 (based on jquery)

https://github.com/mui-org/material-ui (but for React. Not "html+css only")

https://github.com/ant-design/ant-design (But for React, Not "html+css only")


https://github.com/material-components/material-components-web Somehow the distinction between Material guideline and implemention is too complicated for me.

https://github.com/tachyons-css/tachyons no recent updates.

https://github.com/Dogfalo/materialize no recent updates.

https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss components (menu, navigation, ...) are commercial.

https://github.com/picturepan2/spectre (looks like a one-man-show according to commit history)

https://github.com/fomantic/Fomantic-UI Most development was done 2015. Depends on jquery.

https://get.foundation/ was hot 2016, mostly no commits in 2020
